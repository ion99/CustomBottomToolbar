# Custom Toolbar in Titanium that works for iOS and Android.

Many Hybrid frameworks such as Titanium were created from the idea of "code once and deploy to many platforms." But sometimes you can't really do that. For example, you need to put a toolbar at the bottom of the screen  for user options. iOS has this API and Titanium provides the iOS UIToolbar that sticks or stays-put at the bottom.  But Android doesn't have this, and therefore, Titanium doesn't provide the API for it. The recommended Android options should be placed somewhere in the ActionBar.  While that is a good thing, it just doesn't help a developer code once because you'll be making two  option menus. So I decided to experiment and I was able to make a toolbar in Titanium that sticks or stays-put at the bottom of the screen. And, it works for both iOS and Android no problem. Now I'm sharing it.
